        <h2>About Me: <i>A Brief Bio</i></h2>
    
        <p>Greetings! My name is Brandon Hawke and I am a Second year Game Design and Development Major at Rochester Institute of Technology.<br>
        Ever since middle school, I have had an intense passion for creating, designing, and programming video games. I came to RIT in hopes of <br>
        learning what it takes to become a game designer, and how I can secure the "dream job" everyone aspires to have! While at RIT, I plan to <br>
        finish a project that I have been working for over 4 years, complete my immersion in Japanese, and double minor in Japanese and Criminal Justice. <br>        
        </p>
